# Data-Science-Projects
This project deals with first identifying the relation between stringency index and various covid factors from the dataset. Once a relationship is established, we then analyse that relation using visualisations that depict the factors based on a monthly time gap. This project uses the R programming language for the analysis and visualization process.
